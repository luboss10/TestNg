What's testng

testing tool we use -to automate application

why do we need it:
reports
parallel execution
annotation based execution
grouping
data driven testing
multiple options for execution

@Test annotation- this is the main annotation of testing to execute our Test case

it executes test cases in alphabetical order by default

@before method as a precondition that executes before every test case
@after method as a post condition that executes after every test case

=================================
User story 23456- Admin user should be able to login with valid credentials

user story 384t53845-verify the title of the application

======================
priority by default is set to 0
to prioritize the test cases we use this attribute

enabled and disabled - to make any test case enabled and disabled temporarily we use this attribute
=======================
Assertion:
hard assertions- we use for small execution because it stops if encounters error
soft assertions- we use it to execute complete code with musltiple check points and in the end we use
assertAll method to get the collective failure of the test



Testng.xml where the highest level is suite-->test-->packages-->class-->methods@test

groups- we use different groups to separate the test cases
alwayrun=true-we use this attribute to execute the pre- and post-condition from testng.xml file

========================================Class3===============================================

@beforeclass and @afterclass- it executes before and after every class

priority- we use this attribute to prioritize our test cases

enable and disable- to make any test case disabled or enabled we use this attribute

Assertions- we use for verification and validation
hard -the moment it identifies error , it stops execution
soft- it collects all failures untill the end and allows complete code to execute
we use assertAll- method ti get collective failure from it

dependson- to mention the name of depending test case in dependent test case, we use this attribute

testng.xml file- configuration file - to execute all the test cases or some of the test cases in single shot
 Batch execution is possible due to testng.xml file
 package wise
 method wise
 class wise
 group wise

 smoke - test - checking the key functionalities of the application - quick testing

 regression - checking the fixed module and other modules as well is regression testing


 Data provider - it returns 2D array which we used to perform data driven testing

 listener - listen all the events and provide us the details of execution according to the instructions provided
